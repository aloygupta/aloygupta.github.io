</br>
</br>
I wanted to be a poet for long,</br>
Wanted to write some stuff very strong.</br>
Attacking every idea out there,</br>
Every ideology and every dogma here.</br>
</br>
Some people want it suppressed,</br>
They would rather be opressed,</br>
Some are indoctrinated,</br>
With ideas dated and ill fated.</br>
</br>
And, they want to beat me up,</br>
Silence me and lock me up,</br>
Threatening me to not write down,</br>
What I feel and leave the town.</br>
</br>
But, speech should always remain free,</br>
Like the burning sun and deep blue sea.</br>
To defend freedom and not be done,</br>
I bought a pen and bought a gun.</br>
