</br>
</br>
The afternoon is still bright,</br>
The sun dazzles in all its might.</br>
In a pair of sunglasses, I have sought refuge,</br>
I stepped into a sea of crowd, such huge.</br>
</br>
Although I can be seen by most,</br>
I can still pretend to be a ghost,</br>
With hidden eyes, with a sly smile,</br>
An air of nonchalance, that's the style.</br>
</br>
Trying to run away fast and hide,</br>
Every version of myself has died,</br>
The only self that I know,</br>
Is the one that I don't know.</br>
</br>
The evenings are breezy and cool,</br>
I jumped out like a fool,</br>
No sunglasses to hide behind,</br>
I had to make up my mind.</br>
</br>
A thousand versions of me,</br>
I had to choose one to be,</br>
No more I chose any other self,</br>
Finally, I gladly chose myself.</br>
