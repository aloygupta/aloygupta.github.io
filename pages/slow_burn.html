<h1 id="slow-burn">Slow Burn</h1>
<p>Well, I like it slow,</p>
<p>Take it easy with the flow,</p>
<p>The world is uncontrollable,</p>
<p>Unpredictable and uncomfortable</p>
<p>To be taken too seriously,</p>
<p>And we ain&#39;t getting out alive.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Walk slowly while the world keeps running,</p>
<p>Talk with ease while the world keeps hustling,</p>
<p>And you can see how the noise drowns us out,</p>
<p>Makes you unheard and inflicts self doubt.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>You can fight modernity by giving up on it,</p>
<p>Letting life, like a thriller, burn slow.</p>
<p>Not clinging to instant dopamine shots,</p>
<p>But, making it rare, and letting yourself go.</p>
