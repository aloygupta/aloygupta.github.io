</br>
</br>
As the wind blows in my hair,</br>
The thrill and chill in the air,</br>
A long drive I have embarked on,</br>
A short one, others have warned.</br>
</p>
It's been a smooth drive until now,</br>
But, the highway road is getting rough, anyhow.</br>
A car from a distant past has turned up,</br>
I looked at the rear view for a close up.</br>
</p>
It's honking and threatening to overtake,</br>
For a second, I almost pressed my brake.</br>
But, this is a car I know well,</br>
Shall I get into a fist fight, shall I yell?</br>
</p>
It's a car from my distant past,</br>
Had troubled me a lot and is driving fast.</br>
But, I am calmer than I have ever been,</br>
Wearing a smile no one has never seen.</br>
</p>
I have my hands on the wheel,</br>
Detached and numb is what I feel.</br>
I pressed the accelerator and zoomed ahead,</br>
The car in my rear view, started to fade.</br>
